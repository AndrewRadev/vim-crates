# vim-crates

When maintaining Rust projects, this plugin helps with updating the dependencies
in `Cargo.toml` files. It uses the [crates.io](https://crates.io) API to get all
available versions of a crate and caches them.

_[curl](https://curl.haxx.se) needs to be installed._

- If the cursor is on a dependency's version and in insert mode, use
  `<c-x><c-u>` (hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and hit <kbd>x</kbd> then <kbd>u</kbd>) to
  open a completion menu with all available versions (see `:h i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U`).
- Update the current dependency to the latest non-prerelease version via
  `:CratesUp`.
- For each dependency that is out-of-date, indicate the latest version as
  virtual text after the end of the line via `:CratesToggle`. Use it again to
  remove all indicators. This is a
  [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/)-only feature. Customize the colors
  of the indicators like this:

    ```vim
    highlight Crates ctermfg=green ctermbg=NONE cterm=NONE
    " or link it to another highlight group
    highlight link Crates WarningMsg
    ```
  Use `:verb CratesToggle` to see debug messages.
